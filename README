ABOUT

A quick and dirty ID3 tag reader implemented in C# for CS 326 "Programming Languages" course at the University of Nevada Reno.
I decided to create a library (DLL) to handle the heavy lifting and a console application for output, but it could have just as easily been a windows form that displayed the data parsed by the library.

What it does:
Reads ID3v1 tags (with track number if comment length is <= 28 characters).
Reads ID3v2.3 tags following the standards provided at http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0

What it does not:
Write anything - it's strictly read only.
Handle any other file formats of ID3.  The standards of the ID3v2 specify that the version number is within the saved data.  Since there are so many (sometimes seemly random) variations between versions it isn't possible to create a 'general' solution to reading ID3v2 tags of all varieties - it requires specificity.
